By using this system, the farmers of Bangladesh who typically donâ€™t get the proper price can get it. Sometimes they need the loan which they get from the chairman of the village with high interest. By this, most of the time, they lose their homestead also. For these reasons, we will design a system from which they can quickly get the loan with very low interest'
